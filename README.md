# Web Development CA2 (Year 1)

## Overview

This repository contains **CA2** (Continuous Assessment 2) for Year 1 Web Development. It includes a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files demonstrating basic web programming tasks: page layout, styling, user input/feedback, positioning, and simple interactions. The project appears to be part of a course module to help develop front-end web skills.

| `distance.html`        | HTML       | A page involving a distance calculation or display.                           |
| `distancecalc.js`      | JavaScript | Script used on `distance.html` to compute distances or similar functionality. |
| `style.css`            | CSS        | Global styling for all pages: layout, design, typography, colors etc.         |
| `Images/`              | Folder     | Contains image assets (icons, backgrounds or illustrations) used in pages.    |
| `favicon`              | File(s)    | The site’s favicon file(s) for browser tabs.                                  |

## Features

* Static pages built using HTML and CSS.
* Simple JavaScript to add interactive or dynamic behaviour (distance calculation).
* Use of layout / positioning CSS to achieve structured page layouts.
* Feedback form page to gather user responses.
* Clean separation of styling (`style.css`) and behaviour (`distancecalc.js`).

## Usage

To view the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/viterUA/Web-Development-CA2-Y1.git
   ```
2. Open `Index.html` in your web browser.
3. Navigate through the pages via links on the homepage.
4. For the distance calculation page, ensure JavaScript is enabled to allow interactivity.

## Potential Improvements / To Do

* Add form validation (client-side) for the Feedback page.
* Improve accessibility (alt-text for images, semantic HTML).
* Make the site responsive — adjust layouts for mobile / small screens.
* Add a build process or bundling for JavaScript / CSS if complexity increases.
* Add more interactive features, e.g. live feedback submission, dynamic content.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS
* JavaScript
