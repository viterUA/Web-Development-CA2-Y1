    <h1>Reviews</h1>

<div class = "box2">

    <h2>"Quaint and Cosy", Rating: 4/5</h2>

    <p>"I had a great time in this cosy guest house. The room was small but 
        comfortable, with all the necessary amenities for a good night rest. 
        The owners were friendly and welcoming, making sure I had everything I 
        needed throughout my stay. The breakfast served each morning was simple, 
        but tasty and the home made, jams were a nice addition. All in all, an
        enjoyable stay in the Tralee and this place." - Ryan Gosling</p>

    <h2>"Home Away From Home", Rating: 5/5</h2>

    <p>From the moment we arrived to this room with swimming pool we felt 
        like apart of the family in this lovely guest house. The host went 
        above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable, offering helpful tops on local 
        attractions, activities and diwing options. Our room was pretty good with a
        relaxing athmosphere. Breakfast each morning was a highlight, with a variety 
        of fresh, homemade goodies. The location of the guest house was perfect for 
        exploring the area, with stunning scenery just a short walk away. We can't 
        thank the hosts enough for their hospitality and would highly recommend this
        guest house to anyone visiting the Tralee." - Helen Navas</p>
